/**
 * This script shows how to use the Pinterest API asynchronous report functionality
 * to download advertiser delivery metrics reports. It is adapted from sample code
 * from a Pinterest Solutions Engineer that has been useful to advertiser and
 * partner engineers who need to fetch a wide range of metrics.
 * The documentation for this API is here:
 *   https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/combined_reporting/#tag/reports
 *
 * Synchronous metrics retrieval is demonstrated by the get_analytics script
 * in this directory.
 *
 * Using this script requires a login or an access token for a Pinterest
 * user account that has linked Advertiser IDs. (The relationship between User
 * and Advertiser is 1-to-many.) To get a report with useful metrics values,
 * at least one linked Advertiser needs to have an active advertising campaign.
 *
 * The sequence of steps in this script is as follows:
 * 1. Fetch an access token and print summary data about the associated User.
 * 2. Get the linked Advertiser IDs and select one of the Advertiser IDs.
 * 3. Print information about metrics. This step is not typical of a
 *    production application, but does show how to access information
 *    on delivery metrics from the Pinterest API.
 * 4. Configure the options for the asynchronous report, and run the report.
 * 5. Download the report to a file.
