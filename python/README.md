# Python Quickstart

Python code that makes it easy to get started with the Pinterest API.

## Quick Start

1. Follow the directions at the top level of this repo for configuring your application ID and application secret.

2. From the top of this repo, change your working directory to this directory: `cd python`

3. Set up your virtualenv.

   ```
   $ python3 -m venv ./venv/api
   $ . ./venv/api/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the shell environment.

   ```
   $ . ../common/scripts/api_env
   ```

5. Run the simplest sample script.

   ```
   $ ./scripts/get_access_token.py
   ```

## Additional Functionality

After running the Quick Start, you should be able to run any of the use cases in the scripts directory. Scripts that accept arguments use `argparse`, which ensures that the `-h` or `--help` argument shows usage documentation. The code for each script has a comment that documents its intended purpose.
  * `get_access_token.py`: Quick start code that demonstrates the OAuth 2.0 flow and tests the authentication by reading the user profile using the `/v5/user_accounts` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#tag/user_accounts) or the `/v3/users/{user}/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_get_user_handler_GET). Running this script with the `-w` parameter (`./scripts/get_access_token.py -w`) stores the access token in `../common/oauth_tokens/access_token.json` for future use. Use `-w` parameter in combination with the `-a` (access token name) parameter to store separate access tokens for different purposes.
  * `refresh_example.py`: Demonstrates how to refresh an access token.
  * `refresh_access_token.py`: Refreshes an access token stored by using `./scripts/get_access_token.py` with the `-w` (write) argument.
  * `get_pin.py`: Retrieves the information for a specific board with the `/v5/pins/{pin_id}` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#operation/pins/get) or the `/v3/pins/{pin}/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_get_pin_GET).
  * `get_board.py`: Retrieves the information for a specific board with the `/v5/boards/{board_id}` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#operation/boards/get) or the `/v3/boards/{board}/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_get_board_GET).
  * `get_user_pins.py`: Retrieves all of the pins for a user with the `/v3/users/{users}/pins/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_get_pins_handler_GET), using the paging mechanism of the API. There is not an equivalent v5 endpoint, so this script shows how to emulate the behavior in v5.
  * `get_user_boards.py`: Retrieves all of the boards for a user with the `/v5/boards` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#operation/boards/list) or the `/v3/users/{user}/boards/feed/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_user_profile_boards_feed_GET), using the paging mechanism of the API.
  * `copy_pin.py`: Demonstration of how to use the `POST /v5/pins` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#operation/pins/create) or the `PUT /v3/pins/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_create_pin_handler_PUT) to create a pin. Copying a pin can be useful functionality for API developers, but does not represent typical user behavior on Pinterest.
  * `copy_board.py`: Demonstration of how to use the `POST /v3/boards` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#operation/boards/create) or the `PUT /v3/boards/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_create_board_PUT) to create a board. Also uses the `POST /boards/{board_id}/sections` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/v5/#operation/board_sections/create) or the `PUT /v3/board/{self.board_id}/sections/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_create_section_PUT) to create board sections. This script accepts source and target access tokens, so that a board can be copied from one account to another. It also provides an `--all` option that copies all of the boards and pins from a source account into a target account. Copying one or multiple boards can be useful functionality for API developers, but does not represent typical user behavior on Pinterest.
  * `get_businesses.py`: Reads the `/v3/users/{user}/businesses/` [endpoint](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/#operation/v3_get_linked_business_accounts_GET). This script will generate a 400 error if your application does not have access to the `read_advertisers` scope. To see any data, the authorized account needs to have linked business acounts. There is not an equivalent v5 endpoint.
  * `analytics_api_example.py`: Demonstrates how to use the API to generate an asynchronous delivery metrics report using the [request](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/combined_reporting/#operation/ads_v3_create_advertiser_delivery_metrics_report_POST) and [get](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/combined_reporting/#operation/ads_v3_get_advertiser_delivery_metrics_report_handler_GET) endpoints. This script may be implemented for v5 in the future.

In every new shell, you'll need to activate the virtualenv and configure the environment.

```
$ cd python # from the top of this repository
$ . ./venv/api/bin/activate
$ . ../common/scripts/api_env
```

## Common Command-Line Arguments

In general, use the `-h` or `--help` command-line argument with each script to see a complete list of arguments. Here is a list of common arguments that work with all scripts:
  * `-v <version>` or `--api-version <version>`: The version of the Pinterest API to use. The two choices are `3` and `5`.
  * `-a <name>` or `--access-token <name>`: The name of the access token for the script. This name is helpful with the `-w` or `--write` option to `get_access_token.py`, which will store the access token in a file that can be used by other scripts.
  * `-l <level>` or `--log-level <level>`: The level of logging verbosity for the script. `0` is only critical output. `1` generates a bit more output. `2` is the default, and prints a lot of useful information for developers learning the API. `3` is maximal verbosity.

## Tests

Unit tests are in `./tests/src/` and integrations tests are in `./tests/scripts/`. To run the tests, run the following commands in your virtualenv:
```
$ . ./venv/api/bin/activate # always run in a vitualenv
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt # only needed with a new virtualenv or when requirements change
$ make tests
```
The `Makefile` shows how to run the tests with the `nosetests` command. More information is in the [nose documentation](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

## PyCharm

If you want to use PyCharm as the IDE for this code, there are two ways
to configure the environment.

1. Set up the environment and run PyCharm at the command line. This is the best way to keep your Pinterest API credentials secure. For example, on MacOS:

   ```
   $ . ../common/scripts/api_env
   $ /Applications/PyCharm\ CE.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm
   ```

2. Enter the environment variables into the PyCharm environment. Note that PyCharm will store your credentials in its workspace configuration,
which is less secure than keeping the credentials in a file that you control.

   * Print the critical variables.

     ```
     $ . ../common/scripts/api_env
     $ env | grep PINTEREST_APP
     PINTEREST_APP_ID=<number>
     PINTEREST_APP_SECRET=<string>
     ```

   * Start PyCharm.
   * Select Run/Edit Configurations...
   * Select Templates/Python
   * Enter the four list variables above in the Environment variables.

## Code Conventions

The code conventions are set by the standard configurations of the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) linters for python. Run these linters with `make lint`.
