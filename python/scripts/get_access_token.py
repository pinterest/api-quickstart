    """
    This script retrieves an OAuth 2.0 access token. See the "OAuth Authentication"
    section of the top-level README in this repository for more information.

    The arguments for this script are intended to be used as follows:
     -w / --write :
       Save the access token to a file in JSON format so that it can be used with
       other scripts. The name of the file is based on the 'name' attribute of the
       AccessToken object, which defaults to access_token, so the default file name
       is access_token.json. The directory used to store the file is in the
       PINTEREST_OAUTH_TOKEN_DIR environment variable, which is set to
       ../../common/oauth_tokens/ by the api_env script described in the top-level
       README for this repo. The access_token.json file written by this script may be
       renamed so that it is available for future use. For example,

       renaming access_token.json to my_account_token.json could then be retrieved
       by calling:
         AccessToken(api_config, name='my_account_token').fetch()
     -ct / --cleartext :
       It is best practice not to print credentials like access tokens and refresh
       tokens in clear text, so this script prints SHA256 hashes of tokens so that
       developers can check whether token values have changed. However, engineers
       at Pinterest requested the capability to print tokens in clear text, which
       is implemented using this argument.
     -s / --scopes :
       To provide a quick start for new developers, this script requests an access
       token with the default set of scopes for the application provided in the
       environment (with the PINTEREST_APP_ID and PINTEREST_APP_SECRET variables).
       This argument, which requires a comma-separated list of valid OAuth scopes,
       allows experimentation with different sets of scopes. Specifying scopes prevents
       the access token from being read from the environment or file system, and forces
       the use of the browser-based OAuth process.
