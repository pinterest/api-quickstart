# End-to-end (e2e) test set-up code. Must be sourced in the shell that
# runs e2e tests.
#
# The e2e tests are mostly intended to automate testing that used to
# be performed manually at Pinterest. So, all of the accounts specified
# in this file are owned by Pinterest or Pinterest employees.
#
# If you do not work at Pinterest and are interested in using this code,
# please consider sending a pull request that would make it easier. For example,
# the API entities (TEST1, TEST2, TEST3, PIN, BOARD) could be factored out
# in the same way that the api_app_credentials are factored out of api_env.
